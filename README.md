Tesis modelo Gdina aplicado al diagnóstico de desórdenes mentales

When I had to elaborate my master's thesis, I knew that If I was going to dedicate all my free time to a particular subject, it had to be a topic that I was passionate about. 
Well, my main passion is to find something useful for everyone, but other of my passions is "the mind" (how your mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy). 
But I did not know if that was possible. I  was told that there was an available subject, G-DINA models, and that the previous year another statistician had applied a similar model in education. Although I was really interested in that subject, I realized that there was another theme in my mind. I had been very recently diagnosed with anxiety and I was really interested in learning more about it, and when I did a quick search I found out that G-DINA models were also used in the diagnosis of mental disorders.

For me, that was it, that was going to be my theme's tesis. But my professor was not so sure about it and he explained to me that while education data was available, there was no source for mental health data. I assured him that I was going to get the data no matter what. And I did it. I was very lucky and a researcher gave me his anonymized data.

And this is the beginning of the story of this thesis. To be honest, I prefer the beginning than the ending. As I really liked the idea, I did not know how to develop this model in order to obtain a direct benefit to people. 
Even so, I have good memories creating this work
